# Agentic Malware Analysis

Kali-based Docker environment for agentic malware analysis, combining 50+ reverse-engineering tools, a structured analysis orchestrator skill, and MCP-connected disassembler backends ([Binary Ninja][binary-ninja-headless-mcp] or [Ghidra][ghidra-headless-mcp]). Ready for [Claude Code][claude-code] and [Codex CLI][codex-cli].

See the companion blog post [Building a Pipeline for Agentic Malware Analysis][blog-post] for background, a case study, and evaluation.

## Why

Agents can already drive meaningful parts of a malware analysis workflow: they identify strings, resolve imports, recognize API patterns, and produce a first triage that covers the obvious functionality of a sample. However, the quality of the result depends heavily on the environment, the available tooling, and the guidance the agent receives. Without a proper reverse-engineering toolkit, access to a disassembler, and a structured workflow, the analysis stays shallow and misses the deeper logic that matters most -- command dispatch, protocol internals, cryptographic routines, hardcoded configuration, and evasion techniques.

This repository provides a purpose-built environment that gives agents what they need to go significantly further. A Kali-based Docker container ships 50+ RE tools alongside MCP-connected disassembler backends (Binary Ninja or Ghidra), so the agent can disassemble, decompile, follow cross-references, and inspect binary structure directly. A structured orchestrator skill guides the analysis through defined phases -- from fingerprinting and signal ranking through hypothesis generation to deep analysis planning and reporting -- with persistent per-sample case state written to disk at every stage. This means findings survive context-window compaction, the agent can resume after resets, and each phase builds on verified intermediate artifacts rather than fading conversation history.

## Features

- Kali Linux container with 50+ RE and malware analysis tools
- Automatic MCP backend selection (Binary Ninja or Ghidra)
- `malware-analysis-orchestrator` skill for Claude Code and Codex CLI
- Helper scripts for strings, imports, YARA, capa, signal ranking, hypothesis generation
- Bundled YARA rules (crypto, anti-debug/anti-VM, capabilities, packer -- from [Yara-Rules/rules][yara-rules], GPL-2.0)
- Wrapper scripts for Claude Code and Codex with aggressive defaults
- Persistent state across container rebuilds (BN license, Claude auth, Codex auth)
- PE, ELF, and Mach-O support
- Content-hash-based image caching

## Prerequisites

- Docker with `buildx`
- Anthropic API key or Claude account (for Claude Code) or OpenAI API key (for Codex)
- Recommended: Binary Ninja Linux zip with a headless-capable license (see [Setup](#setup) below)

## Quick Start

> **Important:** `run_docker.sh` mounts your current working directory into the container at `/agent`. The agent wrappers run with full permissions (`--dangerously-skip-permissions` / `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`) by design, so the agent can read, write, and execute anything in that directory. Clone the repository into a dedicated directory and place only the files you want the agent to access there.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrphrazer/agentic-malware-analysis.git
cd agentic-malware-analysis
cp /path/to/binaryninja_linux.zip ./binaryninja.zip   # recommended; without it Ghidra is used instead
./run_docker.sh
```

What happens:

1. Prepares a Docker Buildx builder
2. If `binaryninja.zip` is present, Binary Ninja and its MCP server are installed; otherwise Ghidra and its MCP server are installed as a fallback
3. Clones the selected MCP server repo into `mcp/`
4. Builds the image (or reuses a cached one based on content hash)
5. Seeds BN license, Claude credentials, and Codex credentials from host directories
6. Launches the container with the current directory mounted at `/agent`

Inside the container:

```bash
claude   # or: codex
```

Extract the included example sample and start an analysis with the orchestrator skill:

```bash
cd examples && unzip -P infected samples.zip && cd ..
```

Then prompt the agent:

```
Analyze the malware in examples/samples/mfc42ul.dll -- Give me a detailed overview
of the sample's functionality and features, together with the corresponding code
locations. Use the skill /agent/agent_helpers/claude/skills/malware-analysis-orchestrator/
for analysis.
```

See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for sample details and background.

## Setup

### Binary Ninja (recommended)

Binary Ninja provides substantially better analysis results than Ghidra through its [headless MCP server][binary-ninja-headless-mcp] and is the recommended disassembler backend. If no Binary Ninja zip is present, the environment falls back to Ghidra automatically.

To use Binary Ninja, place your Linux headless zip in the repository root **before** running `run_docker.sh`:

```bash
cp /path/to/binaryninja_linux.zip ./binaryninja.zip
```

The file must be named `binaryninja.zip`. Alternatively, point to it explicitly:

```bash
BINARY_NINJA_ZIP=/path/to/binaryninja.zip ./run_docker.sh
```

Binary Ninja requires a valid `license.dat`. On first run, `run_docker.sh` copies your existing license from `~/.binaryninja/license.dat` into a Docker-specific directory (`~/.binaryninja-docker/`) that is mounted into the container at `/home/agent/.binaryninja`. The license is never baked into the image. To use a different host directory:

```bash
BINARY_NINJA_USER_DIR=/path/to/binaryninja-user-dir ./run_docker.sh
```

### Claude Code Authentication

`run_docker.sh` maintains a persistent Claude state directory at `~/.claude-docker/` on the host, mounted into the container at `/home/agent/.claude`. On first run, it seeds credentials from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` if available. You can also log in inside the container with `claude auth`; credentials persist across container rebuilds in the mounted directory. To use a different host directory:

```bash
CLAUDE_USER_DIR=/path/to/claude-dir ./run_docker.sh
```

### Codex CLI Authentication

`run_docker.sh` maintains a persistent Codex state directory at `~/.codex-docker/` on the host, mounted into the container at `/home/agent/.codex`. On first run, it seeds credentials from `~/.codex/auth.json` if available. You can also log in inside the container with `codex login`; credentials persist across container rebuilds in the mounted directory. To use a different host directory:

```bash
CODEX_USER_DIR=/path/to/codex-dir ./run_docker.sh
```

## Docker Environment

### Installed Tooling

**Fingerprinting:** `file`, `sha256sum`, `md5sum`, `ssdeep`, `die`/`diec`, `yara`, `capa`

**String extraction:** `strings`, `floss` (FLARE-FLOSS), `rabin2`

**Disassembly and analysis:** `radare2`, `binwalk`, `gdb`/`gdb-multiarch`, `capstone` (Python)

**Binary utilities:** `objdump`, `readelf`, `nm`, `patchelf`, `elfutils`

**Hex editors:** `hexedit`, `bvi`, `xxd`, `ht`, `hexwalk`

**Dynamic analysis:** `strace`, `ltrace`, `qemu-user`

**Build tools:** `gcc`, `g++`, `clang`, `lldb`, `lld`, `llvm`, `cmake`, `nasm`

**Python:** Python 3, `pip`, `venv`, `ipython`, `ipdb`, `uv`

**Data processing:** `jq`, `yq`

**Extraction:** `upx`, `unblob`, `ropper`

**Node.js:** Node.js 22

**Agent CLIs:** Claude Code, Codex CLI

**Conditional:** Binary Ninja headless + Python API (if zip provided) _or_ Ghidra + `pyghidra`

### Runtime Configuration

- Working directory: `/agent`
- User: `agent` (non-root, passwordless sudo)
- Capabilities: `SYS_PTRACE`, `seccomp=unconfined`
- Volume mounts:
  - Host `.` → `/agent`
  - BN user dir → `/home/agent/.binaryninja`
  - Claude state dir → `/home/agent/.claude`
  - Codex state dir → `/home/agent/.codex`

## MCP Integration

The environment automatically selects and configures one MCP backend. Binary Ninja is recommended; Ghidra serves as a fallback when no Binary Ninja zip is provided.

- **Binary Ninja installed** → [binary-ninja-headless-mcp][binary-ninja-headless-mcp] (registered as `binary_ninja_headless_mcp`)
- **No Binary Ninja** → [ghidra-headless-mcp][ghidra-headless-mcp] (registered as `ghidra_headless_mcp`)

The selected repo is cloned at runtime by `run_docker.sh` into `mcp/`. On container start, `configure-agent-mcp.sh` writes the project-scoped `.mcp.json` (Claude Code) and Codex config with the correct MCP server entry.

Override the upstream repos:

```bash
BINJA_MCP_REPO_URL=https://github.com/mrphrazer/binary-ninja-headless-mcp.git ./run_docker.sh
GHIDRA_MCP_REPO_URL=https://github.com/mrphrazer/ghidra-headless-mcp.git ./run_docker.sh
```

## Malware Analysis Orchestrator

The `malware-analysis-orchestrator` skill drives a structured, multi-phase malware analysis workflow. It is available for both [Claude Code](agent_helpers/claude/skills/malware-analysis-orchestrator/SKILL.md) and [Codex CLI](agent_helpers/codex/skills/malware-analysis-orchestrator/SKILL.md).

### Workflow Stages

1. **Intake and fingerprinting** -- hashes, file type, packer/compiler detection, YARA scan, capa scan
2. **Raw strings collection** -- `strings`, `rabin2`, `floss` with source tags
3. **Raw API/import collection** -- `rabin2`, format-specific tools (PE/ELF/Mach-O)
4. **Signal filtering and ranking** -- score and rank interesting strings and imports by capability
5. **Hypothesis generation** -- cross-link evidence, generate behavior hypotheses with confidence and evidence
6. **Component inventory and interaction modeling** -- infer components, map data/control flow
7. **Deep analysis planning and prioritization** -- ordered tasks with target functions, expected findings, stop criteria
8. **Reporting** -- executive summary, technical findings, IOCs, open questions

### Case Directory

Each analysis creates a persistent per-sample directory at `status/<NNN>-<filename>/` containing 13 required artifact files:

| # | File | Content |
|---|------|---------|
| 1 | `00_sample_profile.md` | Hashes, file type, packer, YARA, capa results |
| 2 | `01_strings_raw.txt` | All extracted strings with source tags |
| 3 | `02_strings_interesting.md` | Ranked interesting strings with categories |
| 4 | `03_imports_raw.txt` | Full import tables with source tags |
| 5 | `04_imports_interesting.md` | Suspicious API clusters by capability |
| 6 | `05_behavior_hypotheses.md` | Hypotheses with confidence and evidence |
| 7 | `06_component_inventory.md` | Inferred components with roles and evidence |
| 8 | `07_interaction_model.md` | Data and control flow between components |
| 9 | `08_deep_analysis_plan.md` | Ordered deep-analysis tasks |
| 10 | `09_priority_queue.md` | Priority queue with rationale and blockers |
| 11 | `10_reporting_draft.md` | Executive summary and technical findings |
| 12 | `INDEX.md` | Artifact list, timestamps, missing items |
| 13 | `CURRENT_STATE.json` | Machine-readable phase and progress state |

This externalized state is what makes the workflow resilient to context-window compaction: the agent reads case files back from disk instead of relying on conversation history.

### Helper Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `init_status_tree.sh` | Create or reuse a case directory for a sample |
| `collect_strings.sh` | Run `strings`, `rabin2 -zz`, `floss` and write raw output |
| `collect_imports.sh` | Run `rabin2 -i` and format-specific import tools |
| `scan_yara.sh` | Scan sample with bundled YARA rules |
| `scan_capa.sh` | Run capa for ATT&CK/MBC capability identification |
| `rank_signals.py` | Score and rank interesting strings and imports |
| `build_hypothesis.py` | Generate baseline behavior hypotheses (optional) |
| `update_state.py` | Update `CURRENT_STATE.json` with phase transitions |
| `resolve_case.sh` | Resolve the latest case directory for a sample |

### Bundled YARA Rules

Four rule sets from [Yara-Rules/rules][yara-rules] (GPL-2.0):

- `crypto_signatures.yar` -- cryptographic algorithm and constant detection
- `antidebug_antivm.yar` -- anti-debug and anti-VM technique detection
- `capabilities.yar` -- malicious capability detection
- `packer_compiler_signatures.yar` -- packer and compiler signature detection

### Roles

- **Orchestrator** -- drives phases, enforces artifact completeness, schedules parallel collection
- **Planner** -- consumes intermediate evidence, generates hypotheses, defines deep-analysis priorities
- **Reporter** -- produces executive and technical summaries with traceable evidence

## Limitations

- Agent runs are non-deterministic -- repeated analyses of the same sample may produce different results
- Context-window constraints limit single-pass depth; the orchestrator mitigates this with externalized state
- Agents may produce overconfident or incorrect claims -- expert validation is required
- The orchestrator focuses on static analysis; dynamic analysis tools are available but not orchestrated
- The container runs with elevated permissions by design (see Security)

## Security

- `SYS_PTRACE` and `seccomp=unconfined` are required for debugging and dynamic analysis -- intentional
- Agent wrappers default to full permissions inside the container sandbox -- by design for autonomous analysis
- MCP communication is unauthenticated (stdio transport)
- Do not expose the container to untrusted networks or users
- The Binary Ninja license is stored on the host, not in the image
